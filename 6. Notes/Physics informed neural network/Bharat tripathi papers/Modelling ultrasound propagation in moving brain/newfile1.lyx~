Shockwave (compressible flow)(non-linear acoustics)(discontinuous shockwave)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the speed of a source equals the speed of sound (v = c) the wave fronts
 cannot escape the source.
 The resulting pile of waves forms a large amplitude "sound barrier" that
 makes sustained flight at this speed difficult and risky.
 When the speed of a source exceeds the speed of sound (v > c) the wave
 fronts lag behind the source in a cone-shaped region with the source at
 the vertex.
 The edge of the cone forms a supersonic wave front with an unusually large
 amplitude called a "shock wave".
 When a shock wave reaches an observer a "sonic boom" is heard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ratio of the speed of a moving object (v) to the speed of sound (c)
 in a fluid is known as the Mach number (Ma) .

Shear shockwave
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recently, a new type of shock wave has been observed experimentally with
 high-frame-rate ultrasound: shear shock waves in soft solids.
 These strongly nonlinear waves are characterized by a high Mach number,
 because the shear wave velocity is much slower, by 3 orders of magnitude,
 than the longitudinal wave velocity.
 Furthermore, these waves have a unique cubic nonlinearity which generates
 only odd harmonics.
 Unlike longitudinal waves for which only compressional shocks are possible,
 shear waves exhibit cubic nonlinearities which can generate positive and
 negative shocks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have recently observed, experimentally, that shear shock waves are generated
 deep inside the brain starting from a low initial acceleration (sub-concussive
 range).
 This observation has motivated the development of simulation tools to model
 shear shock waves in the human head.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We present a simulation approach to generate ultrasound images of the brain
 undergoing nonlinear elastic motion due to a traumatic impact.
 Finite difference simulations can model ultrasound propagation through
 the multi-scale heterogeous representation of human tissues.
 Finite Differ- ence Time Domain (FDTD) methods can directly model wave
 propagation and hence, account for physical phenomena such as single and
 multiple scattering, reflection and refraction.
 The backscattered energy received at the transducer surface can then be
 beamformed into a highly realistic ultrasound image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A FDTD-based simulation tool (referred herein as “Fullwave”) that we have
 previously developed [26], uses a second-order method to describe nonlinear
 propagation of acoustical waves in heterogeneous, attenuating media, such
 as the soft tissue of the human body.
