\begin_layout Standard
Among the three key components required to solve a continuum biomechanics
 problem, i.e., the geometry (the domain of interest), the constitutive relations
 (how the material responds to applied loads under conditions of interest),
 and the applied loads (or associated boundary conditions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, the approach to identify a robust constitutive model follows
 the DEICE procedure [4]: (1) Delineation of general characteristic behaviors,
 (2) Establishment of an appropriate theoretical framework, (3) Identification
 of specific functional forms of the constitutive relation, (4) Calculation
 of the values of the material parameters, and (5) Evaluation of the predictive
 capability of the final constitutive relation.
 Dr.
 Y.
 C.
 Fung discovered the famous Green-strain based, exponential form of the
 strain–energy function for soft tissues, iconized now as the Fung-elastic
 model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Briefly, Fung showed that preconditioned soft tissue can be considered pseudo-el
astic [5,6], and the slope of load–deflection curve is proportional to the
 load in uniaxial elongation tests of rabbit mesentery.
 Consequently, an exponential function was used to account for the nonlinearity
 of the stress–strain curve for soft tissues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Humphrey et al.
 performed constant invariant biaxial experiments, in which each of the
 strain invariant was independently varied, to infer specific functional
 forms of strain invariant-based constitutive equations.
 Based on the experimental observations, a polynomial form of the strain–energy
 function was devised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To formulate a microstructurally-motivated constitutive model, Holzapfel
 et al.
 [9] modeled the arterial tissue as bi-layer fiber-reinforced composite,
 in which the contributions of a ground matrix and collagen fibers can be
 modeled separately in a strain–energy function.

\begin_layout Standard
The Universal Approximation Theorem tells us that Neural Networks has a
 kind of universality i.e.
 no matter what f(x) is, there is a network that can approximately approach
 the result and do the job! This result holds for any number of inputs and
 outputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditional feedforward fully-connected neural networks (FFNN) have been
 used to model the strain (input) and stress (output) relations.
 Compared to an expert-constructed model, a FFNN-based constitutive model
 has three major disadvantages: (1) a large number of constitutive parameters
 with no physical meanings, in contrast to only a few constitutive parameters
 in an expert-constructed model.
 (2) An expert-constructed model can not only delineate and capture the
 general mechanical behaviors of a class of materials, but also can accurately
 model an individual subject (e.g.
 individual material responses) by fine tuning the constitutive parameters.
 The model parameters of FFNN-based models for different subjects are completely
 independent to each other.
 (3) a FFNN-based model cannot guarantee its convexity, which is important
 for ensuring the model is physically meaningful with unambiguous mechanical
 behaviors.

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we developed a novel neural network-based material model
 (NNMat) which employs a physics constraint and a hierarchical learning
 strategy (Fig.
 1): (1) establishing constitutive laws to describe general characteristic
 behaviors of a class of materials; (2) determining constitutive parameters
 for an individual subject.
 These two steps are equivalent to 3rd and 4th steps of the DEICE procedure.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The neural network structure consists of two parameter sets corresponding
 to the two steps: (1) a “class” parameter set for characterizing the general
 elastic properties of the class of materials; and (2) a “subject” parameter
 set with three parameters for modeling individual material response.

Soft biological tissues comprise bundles of collagen fibers embedded in

Constitutive modeling of the hyperelastic tissues is often achieved by specifyin
g the strain energy density W as a function of deformation gradient W(F),
 where F represents the deformation gradient tensor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph*
There are lots of materials that does not follow the linear elastic model
 in the elastic zone.
 For example, the rubber is a non-linear elastic material.
 For such material so called hyperelastic, the constitutive equation is
 no more 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\epsilon E$
\end_inset

.
 Instead, the stress-strain relation is governed by something called the
 strain energy density function W and deformation gradient tensor F.

Similarly, for complex materials, the derivative of strain energy density
 function W can be taken wrt to the strain tensor using the directional
 derivative.
 or to simplify the things, we can take the derivative w.r.t.
 to the eigenvalues aka the strain invariants of the strain tensor to avoid
 using the directional derivative and breakdown the derivatives to simple
 functions using the eigendecomposition.

Strain energy density
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strain-energy density of a material is defined as the strain energy
 per unit volume.
 It is equal to the area under the stress-strain diagram of a material,
 measured from 
\begin_inset Formula $ε_{x}$
\end_inset

 = 0 to 
\begin_inset Formula $ε_{x}$
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Formula $ε_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the normal strain.
 For anisotropic material, the strain energy density function depends on
 the two fiber directions that are assumed to be symmetric about an axis
